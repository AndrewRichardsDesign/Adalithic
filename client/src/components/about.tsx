      <p>
        Arcatext is a custom keyboard and language application designed to help users write,
        translate, reword, and better understand messages across languages. This Privacy Policy
        explains what information Arcatext processes, how that information is used, when it is
        stored, when it may be shared, and what choices you have.
      </p>
      <p>By using Arcatext, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">1. Who We Are</h3>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">2. Information We Process</h3>
      <p>
        Arcatext is designed to process only the information needed to provide, improve,
        personalize, and support the app's language features.
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium">A. Text You Choose to Translate, Reword, Check, or Analyze</p>
      <p>
        When you use Arcatext features such as translation, Rewording, reverse translation,
        synonym suggestions, grammar assistance, meaning clarification, or learning feedback, the
        text you submit may be processed by Arcatext and may be sent to third-party AI service
        providers so the requested feature can function.
      </p>
      <p>This may include:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Messages you type into the Arcatext keyboard</li>
        <li>Messages you choose to Reword</li>
        <li>Text you select for translation or rewording</li>
        <li>Text you ask Arcatext to check, explain, or transform</li>
        <li>
          Context needed to improve translation or Rewording quality, such as selected language,
          script, tone, formality, or gender settings
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className="font-medium">B. Reworded Messages Linked to Your Profile</p>
      <p>Arcatext may store messages that you Reword in order to provide:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Progress tracking</li>
        <li>Personalized learning features</li>
        <li>Writing history</li>
        <li>Language-learning insights</li>
        <li>Other Arcatext features</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These Reworded messages may be linked to your Arcatext profile so that the app can show
        you information such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Your Rewording history</li>
        <li>Your learning progress</li>
        <li>Your language practice patterns</li>
        <li>Your most-used languages or features</li>
        <li>Performance metrics related to your use of Arcatext</li>
        <li>Personalized recommendations or learning tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reworded messages that remain connected to your profile are treated as confidential user
        data. Adalithic LLC does not sell, license, or share profile-linked Reworded messages with
        outside companies, advertisers, data brokers, or unrelated third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Profile-linked Reworded messages are used internally by Adalithic LLC to provide
        Arcatext's features, maintain the app, improve user experience, and support
        learning-related functionality.
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium">C. Keyboard Settings and Language Preferences</p>
      <p>Arcatext may process app settings and language preferences, such as:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Source language</li>
        <li>Target language</li>
        <li>Keyboard language</li>
        <li>Alphabet or script options, such as standard script or romanized text</li>
        <li>
          Speaker gender, recipient gender, or group-chat gender settings when needed for
          translation accuracy
        </li>
        <li>Tone, formality, or learning preferences</li>
        <li>Feature preferences inside the app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These settings are used to provide the keyboard, translation, Rewording, and learning
        experience. Some settings may be stored locally on your device or linked to your profile
        if you create or use an Arcatext account.
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium">D. Account Information</p>
      <p>
        If Arcatext offers account-based features, we may collect and store account information
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Username</li>
        <li>Password or authentication credentials</li>
        <li>Subscription status</li>
        <li>App preferences</li>
        <li>Profile settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Passwords, if used, are not stored in plain text. Authentication may also be handled by
        third-party identity providers, app-store providers, or platform services.
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium">E. Device and Platform Information</p>
      <p>
        Arcatext may access device and platform information needed to provide functionality,
        initialize settings, improve performance, and support compatibility across devices and
        operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>This may include:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Device language settings</li>
        <li>Device type</li>
        <li>Operating system version</li>
        <li>App version</li>
        <li>Platform-related configuration information</li>
        <li>Permission status information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used to configure and support the app experience and is not intended
        to directly identify you.
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium">F. Basic Technical and Diagnostic Information</p>
      <p>
        Arcatext may process limited technical information needed to operate, secure, improve, or
        troubleshoot the app, such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Crash logs</li>
        <li>Performance data</li>
        <li>Error reports</li>
        <li>Basic usage events</li>
        <li>Whether a feature was opened, completed, or failed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where possible, this information is collected in a way that does not directly identify you.</p>
      <p className="font-medium">G. Information We Do Not Intentionally Collect</p>
      <p>Arcatext does not intentionally collect:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Your precise location</li>
        <li>Your contacts</li>
        <li>Your photos</li>
        <li>Your full payment card information</li>
        <li>The content of everything you type outside Arcatext features</li>
        <li>Passwords typed into other apps</li>
        <li>Security codes typed into other apps</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Arcatext processes text that you choose to submit through Arcatext features. Arcatext does
        not use keyboard permissions to secretly collect all text you type.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">
        3. Custom Keyboard Permissions and Network Access
      </h3>
      <p>
        Arcatext functions as a third-party keyboard and language tool. Some features may require
        additional permissions, internet connectivity, or device-level access depending on your
        device, operating system, or platform.
      </p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          On Apple devices, users may need to enable "Allow Full Access" for certain keyboard and
          online language features.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Android devices, users may be asked to grant permissions related to keyboard
          functionality, internet access, notifications, or app features.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These permissions may be necessary for features such as:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>AI translation</li>
        <li>Rewording</li>
        <li>Reverse translation</li>
        <li>Language checking</li>
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Learning features</li>
        <li>Cloud-based language processing</li>
        <li>Account synchronization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When these permissions are enabled, Arcatext may send the text you choose to process to
        our service providers so the requested feature can function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcatext does not use keyboard permissions to secretly collect everything you type, track
        unrelated typing activity, or monitor information outside Arcatext features.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should not use Arcatext to type passwords, payment information, security codes, or
        other highly sensitive information. Some operating systems may automatically switch to the
        system keyboard for password fields, but users should still exercise caution when entering
        sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can disable keyboard permissions, internet permissions, or related access settings at
        any time through your device settings, although some Arcatext features may stop
        functioning properly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">4. How We Use Information</h3>
      <p>
        Arcatext uses information for purposes related to providing, personalizing, analyzing,
        securing, and improving the app.
      </p>
      <p>We may use information to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Translate text</li>
        <li>Reword messages</li>
        <li>Provide alternative phrasings or synonyms</li>
        <li>Check the meaning of a translation</li>
        <li>Explain language choices</li>
        <li>Support different scripts or romanization options</li>
        <li>Apply gender, tone, or formality settings</li>
        <li>Store Reworded messages for user-facing learning features</li>
        <li>Provide performance metrics and progress tracking</li>
        <li>Personalize language-learning recommendations</li>
        <li>Improve app reliability and performance</li>
        <li>Improve Arcatext's language systems and large language model features</li>
        <li>Detect bugs, crashes, abuse, or security issues</li>
        <li>Maintain app security</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use profile-linked Reworded messages to create advertising profiles.</p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">
        5. AI Processing and Third-Party Service Providers
      </h3>
      <p>
        To provide translation and language features, Arcatext may send submitted text and related
        settings to third-party AI service providers, such as OpenAI.
      </p>
      <p>
        These providers process the text to return translations, Rewordings, explanations, or
        other language outputs. Their handling of data is governed by their own privacy policies,
        terms, and processing practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of this policy's last update, OpenAI states that data submitted through its API is not
        used to train or improve OpenAI models by default unless the customer opts in. Arcatext
        does not intentionally opt in to model training for user-submitted translation content
        unless this policy is updated to say otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>Arcatext may also use service providers for:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>App hosting</li>
        <li>Database storage</li>
        <li>Analytics</li>
        <li>Crash reporting</li>
        <li>Customer support</li>
        <li>Security monitoring</li>
        <li>Authentication</li>
        <li>Payment processing</li>
        <li>AI processing and language model functionality</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers are allowed to process information only as needed to provide services to
        Arcatext and Adalithic LLC.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">6. Storage of Reworded Messages</h3>
      <p>Arcatext may store messages that you Reword so that we can provide:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Performance metrics</li>
        <li>Learning features</li>
        <li>User history</li>
        <li>Progress tracking</li>
        <li>Personalized language tools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When Reworded messages are linked to your profile, they may be associated with information
        such as your account, email address, username, app preferences, or usage history. This
        connection allows Arcatext to provide personalized features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Profile-linked Reworded messages are confidential and are not sold, licensed, or shared
        outside Adalithic LLC except with service providers who process the data on our behalf to
        operate Arcatext.
      </p>
      <p>Examples of features that may rely on stored Reworded messages include:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Tracking your improvement over time</li>
        <li>Showing language-learning statistics</li>
        <li>Helping you review past Reworded messages</li>
        <li>Identifying grammar or vocabulary patterns</li>
        <li>Improving personalized recommendations</li>
        <li>Supporting future learning tools inside Arcatext</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">
        7. Anonymized and De-Identified Language Data
      </h3>
      <p>
        Arcatext and Adalithic LLC may use stored messages and language interactions to improve
        language systems, translation quality, Rewording features, and large language model
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arcatext and Adalithic LLC may also create anonymized, de-identified, or aggregated
        language datasets derived from user-submitted messages. These datasets may be used
        internally or shared, licensed, or sold to third parties, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Language-related data partners</li>
        <li>Research partners</li>
        <li>AI training partners</li>
        <li>Language-related data brokers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Before such data is shared, licensed, or sold, Adalithic LLC will take steps designed to
        remove direct identifiers such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Email addresses</li>
        <li>Usernames</li>
        <li>Passwords</li>
        <li>Account IDs</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
        <li>Other direct profile identifiers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anonymized or de-identified datasets are not intended to identify you personally or be
        associated with a specific user profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no anonymization or de-identification process can guarantee that re-identification
        is impossible in every circumstance. Adalithic LLC uses reasonable safeguards designed to
        reduce this risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adalithic LLC will not knowingly sell or license language data that remains directly
        associated with your email, username, password, or Arcatext profile.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">8. Sale or Licensing of Data</h3>
      <p>
        Adalithic LLC may sell, license, or otherwise provide anonymized, de-identified, or
        aggregated language data to third parties for language-related purposes, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Language research</li>
        <li>AI training</li>
        <li>Translation improvement</li>
        <li>Linguistic analysis</li>
        <li>Development of language technologies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Adalithic LLC does not sell profile-linked Reworded messages that identify or are directly
        associated with your Arcatext profile.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">9. Data Retention</h3>
      <p>
        We retain information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described
        in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
      </p>
      <p>In general:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Reworded messages linked to your profile may be retained while your account is active or
          as needed to provide features and metrics.
        </li>
        <li>App preferences may be stored locally on your device or linked to your profile.</li>
        <li>
          Technical logs may be temporarily retained for debugging, reliability, abuse prevention,
          or security purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Support messages may be retained as needed to respond to users and maintain support
          records.
        </li>
        <li>
          Anonymized, de-identified, or aggregated datasets may be retained for longer periods
          because they are not intended to identify a specific user.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-semibold text-secondary pt-2">10. Sensitive Information</h3>
      <p>
        Arcatext is a language tool, not a secure vault. You should not submit highly sensitive
        information for translation, Rewording, checking, or learning features.
      </p>
      <p>Avoid entering:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Passwords</li>
        <li>Credit card numbers</li>
        <li>Bank information</li>
